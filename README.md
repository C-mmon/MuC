# Interactive Record Player
Old School Music Player
This project is a simple JavaScript music player but I thought my favorite rock band deserves one! The main aim of this project was to build something using the very basics of HTML/ CSS/ and of course vanilla JS. One step further for mastering the DOM! This music player allows you to play the record and to switch to the next song. Enjoy it! ;)

User can play, pause, skip, rewind, and scrub through a song


# Running the player
The index.html file can be run on any modern browser to run the music player.

# Adding more tracks
The tracks are currently being loaded from the tracklist array specified in main.js. More tracks can be added by adding the details of each track as an object to the tracklist.
